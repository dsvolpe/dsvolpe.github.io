ðŸš§ This page is currently under construction using the [al-folio Jekyll template](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio). Template language will inhabit it for a bit! ðŸš§

I am a Senior Faculty Specialist at the University of Maryland [IPST](https://ipst.umd.edu) (Institute for Physical Science & Technology). My areas of expertise are:
- Education and training program administration
- Grant proposal development, from ideation to submission
- Science outreach

I am also interested in these areas and open to growing my expertise in them:
- Convergence between arts and sciences
- Education research
- Arts (especially graphic design and animation)

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
